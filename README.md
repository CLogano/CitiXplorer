# CitiXplorer
Application that recommends historical attractions to visit in any city around the world.



## Information about the project

This app is designed to generate up to 10 historical attractions for any inputted city by the user.
Each attraction contains pictures, ratings, user reviews and other relevant data from Google Maps, and is enhanced with unique descriptions created by ChatGPT.
Each attraction has a short description, and an optional lengthy one which goes into detail about the history of the place, areas of interest in the vicinity, and reasons for visiting.
Attractions are displayed on a Google map. Users can interact with each attraction through a list on the left side of the screen or through custom markers on the map.
Users can also learn more about the city through the "City" tab on the far left of the screen, which shows a summary of the city's history (generated by ChatGPT) along with accompanying pictures.

I came up with the idea for this app while studying abroad in France in my junior year of college. My friends and I frequently traveled on weekends, and we would have a hard time deciding on places to go to in each city we visited.
I enjoy learning about the history and culture of different cities, so I thought this app would be a great idea!



## Steps to run the application

1. Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download). This application utilizes version `18.15.0`.
2. Make sure git is properly installed and run `git clone` in the target directory.
3. Install `node_modules` in `/backend` and `/frontend` by running `npm install` in each respective folder.
4. Create a `.env` file in `/backend` and `/frontend` to store API keys and other sensitive information.
5. Obtain the necessary API keys, etc. by following the steps at the bottom of the page and paste them into the `.env` files (see each `.env_sample` as a reference). Replace the placeholder text on the right hand side with the key wrapped in `""`. For example, `GOOGLE_API_KEY="aDFsIMnP3dtJuN0w"`
6. In two seperate terminals, navigate to `/frontend` in one and `/backend` in the other.
