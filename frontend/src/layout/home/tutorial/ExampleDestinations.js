It is always so many people so better to get all tickets booked online. Staff was helpful however many people not know English. But overall please visit it in evening for spectacular view.",

                "text": "1. Material: The tower is primarily made of iron, specifically iron girders and beams. Over 18,000 individual iron pieces were used in its construction.\n\n2. Lattice Design: Gustave Eiffel's team designed the tower with a lattice structure, which means it consists of a network of interconnected iron bars and supports. This design choice not only makes the tower visually appealing but also provides stability.\n\n3. Three Levels: The Eiffel Tower has three main levels that visitors can access. These levels are connected by elevators and stairs, and each level has its own observation deck with panoramic views of Paris.\n\n4. Height: The tower stands at a height of 324 meters (1,063 feet) including its antennas. It was the tallest man-made structure in the world when it was completed in 1889 and held that title for several decades.\n\n5. Arch Design: The tower's arches and diagonals give it strength and stability, allowing it to withstand wind and weather. It was engineered to sway slightly in the wind, which prevents it from suffering structural damage during strong gusts.\n\n6. Construction: Construction of the Eiffel Tower began in 1887 and took just over two years to complete. It was assembled using over 2.5 million rivets, which were a modern engineering innovation at the time.\n\nOverall, the Eiffel Tower's intricate iron lattice structure is both functional and aesthetically pleasing, making it an architectural masterpiece and an enduring symbol of France.",

The stained glass windows are spectacular, tall, slender colorful, original! I was mesmerized from start to finish, my photos do not do it justice. It must be witnessed in person. Do not miss it or its really beautiful Rose window! You will not be disappointed. Get the guided tour, it's worth it as you will find out so much more than what you'll learn just by reading the laminated information cards they have in each area.",
